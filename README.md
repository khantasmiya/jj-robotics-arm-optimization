# ðŸ¤– Johnson & Johnson â€“ Surgical Robotics Optimization

This project simulates an internship at **Johnson & Johnson** focused on identifying and resolving performance delays in surgical robotic systems. The core objective was to **diagnose control issues** and propose **design-level optimizations** using Python.

## ðŸ§ª Project Highlights
- Diagnosed delayed `rotate_joint` function using Python diagnostics
- Conducted response time analysis for `move_arm`, `rotate_joint`, and `adjust_grip`
- Proposed and tested design changes using **SciPy/NumPy** to reduce delay by **35%**
- Delivered a professional **engineering design proposal** with testing metrics and diagrams

## ðŸ”§ Technical Skills
`Python` `Control Systems` `NumPy` `SciPy` `Real-Time Diagnostics` `Robotic Motion Tuning` `Technical Reporting`

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `robotics_diagnostics_report.docx` â€“ Full root-cause report
- `robotics_design_proposal.docx` â€“ Optimization proposal + results
- `check_response_time.py` â€“ Python diagnostic tool (simulated)

## ðŸ’¡ Outcome
Improved robotic responsiveness, safety, and control efficiency â€” simulating real-world engineering impact in a high-stakes surgical setting.
